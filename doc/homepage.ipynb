    "\n",
    "\"The basic concept employed in the stochastic approach is the computer simulation of\n",
    "multi-thousand years of flood annual maxima. This is accomplished by utilizing a deterministic\n",
    "flood computation model (HSAMI) and treating the hydrometeorological input\n",
    "parameters as variables instead of fixed values. Monte Carlo sampling procedures are used to\n",
    "allow the climatic and storm related input parameters to vary in accordance with that observed\n",
    "in nature. Multi-thousand years of extreme storm and flood annual maxima are generated by\n",
    "computer simulation. The simulation for each year contains a set of climatic and storm\n",
    "parameters that were selected through Monte Carlo procedures based on the historical record\n",
    "and collectively preserves dependencies between the hydrometeorological input parameters.\n",
    "Execution of the UBC Watershed Model, and reservoir routing of the inflow floods provides the\n",
    "computation of a corresponding multi-thousand year series of annual maxima flood\n",
    "characteristics. Characteristics of the simulated floods such as peak discharge, maximum\n",
    "reservoir release, runoff volume, and maximum reservoir level are the flood parameters of\n",
    "interest. An annual maxima series is created for each of these flood parameters and the values\n",
    "are ranked in descending order of magnitude and a non-parametric plotting position formula\n",
    "and probability-plots are used to describe the magnitude-frequency relationships.\" (Schaefer and al.)"
